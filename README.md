## Stakeholders

### Henry Lam

#### Goal:
What courses do I need to take in order to graduate?
What courses have I taken already?
How many credits have I taken?
What prerequisites do I need to take? (What order should I take my courses?)
Can I fit a minor into my degree progression?

#### Frustrations:
Degree progress report does not provide a readable user-friendly interface.
Too hard to navigate as there are many tabs/links.
It doesnâ€™t tell me what courses I should take next semester or how many free electives I can take. (There is an Academic Planner but it isn't help and does the minimum. Stakeholder usually seek guidance from academic advisors rather than the degree progress report or academic planner)
